# Organization Filtering Improvements

This document describes the improvements made to the organization filtering system in the application.

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing inconsistent organization filtering when a superadmin would switch between organizations. Despite the URL parameter setting the organization properly in the session, the filtering was not being properly applied across all controllers, resulting in data from different organizations being displayed.

## Solution: OrganizationTrait

We've created a reusable trait `OrganizationTrait` that standardizes the way organization filtering is handled across the application. This ensures consistent behavior and reduces code duplication.

### Key Components:

1. **OrganizationTrait Methods:**
   - `getCurrentOrganizationId()` - Retrieves the current organization ID for filtering
   - `applyOrganizationFilter($model, $organizationId)` - Applies the organization filter to a model query
   - `prepareOrganizationData($data)` - Prepares organization-related data for views
   - `refreshOrganizationContext()` - Forces refresh of organization context from session

2. **Controllers Updated:**
   - PortfoliosController
   - ClientsController
   - InvoicesController
   - PaymentsController

3. **Debug Tools:**
   - Added `/debug/orgContext` endpoint for testing organization switching
   - Added detailed logging for organization context

## How it Works

1. The `OrganizationFilter` (middleware) handles URL parameters (`org_id` and `clear_org`) and updates the session accordingly
2. The `Auth::organizationId()` method returns the appropriate organization ID based on user role
3. The `OrganizationTrait` methods provide a consistent way to apply organization filtering in controllers

## Testing

Superadmins can now test organization switching by visiting:
1. `/debug/orgContext` - Shows detailed organization information and allows switching
2. Visit different sections (portfolios, clients, invoices, payments) to verify that the data is properly filtered

The trait also includes detailed logging to help diagnose any issues.

## Additional Improvements

1. The organization filter is now forcefully refreshed at the beginning of each index method
2. Consistent organization context is passed to all views
3. Detailed logging has been added to trace organization filtering issues
4. Organization dropdown in the navbar now shows the currently selected organization
5. The session context is more reliable due to explicit refresh in the trait

## Maintenance

When adding new controllers that need organization filtering:
1. Use the `use App\Traits\OrganizationTrait;` statement at the top of the class
2. Add `use OrganizationTrait;` within the class
3. Call `$currentOrgId = $this->refreshOrganizationContext();` at the beginning of your index method
4. Apply filtering with `$this->applyOrganizationFilter($model, $currentOrgId);`
5. Prepare view data with `$data = $this->prepareOrganizationData($data);`
